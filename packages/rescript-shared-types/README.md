TODO

Note to self:

The types used in generators.
For generators written in ReScript the idea is that you'll only need this package as a dependency.
For generators written in JavaScript we make sure to not use any types here that we'll be hard to work with in JavaScript.

TODO:

- rename. pg-generator-types? pg-generator-helpers?
- consider adding Flow/TypeScript definitions
- consider adding some utilities that will be usefull in generators
